            <p>Bangladesh's Honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is mother of humanity.She is very kind-hearted.: In
                the
                last 10 years, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has helped increase food production and the average life
                expectancy in Bangladesh. Back in 1974, Bangladesh suffered from mass starvation. Today, the
                self-sufficiency the country has obtained from economic growth helps it feed its population of 166
                million
                people. During Hasinaâ€™s office, the percentage of people living in poverty in Bangladesh has decreased
                from
                19 percent to 9 percent, while the life expectancy has increased from 69.3 years in 2008 to 72.8 years
                in
                2017.</p>
